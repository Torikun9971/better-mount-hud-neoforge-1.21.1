# Better Mount HUD for NeoForge 1.21.1

</div>

This is a mod that I ported before I knew about [Leave My Bars Alone](https://modrinth.com/mod/leave-my-bars-alone).  
Since I’ll probably use that mod myself from now on, I uploaded this one to give it a proper send-off so it wouldn’t be left forgotten.

I think it’s easier to understand the mod’s description by checking the [original mod’s homepage](https://modrinth.com/mod/better-mount-hud), so I’ve included the link here.
